  <h2>The Myth of Neutrality</h2>
  <p>Turns out “smart” tech might be smart like a 1950s hiring manager… Algorithms don’t live in a vacuum — they reflect the values, biases, and blind spots of the people and institutions who build them.</p>
  
  <p>In <strong>Algorithms of Oppression</strong>, Safiya Noble demonstrates how search engines like Google surface dehumanizing and stereotypical content when users search for terms like “Black girls.” These results aren’t accidental. They stem from ranking algorithms that prioritize engagement and profit over ethics or accuracy. Noble argues this isn't a glitch in the system — it's the system working as designed within capitalist and discriminatory frameworks.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Hazel Henderson</strong>, in “Progress or Collective Insanity,” warns against our overreliance on the idea that technology equals progress. She points out how innovations are often developed within narrow economic structures that serve existing power hierarchies. Instead of broadening access and opportunity, digital tools often reinforce societal inequalities when left unchecked.</p>

  <div class="quote">“Search is a mirror of users’ beliefs and that society still holds a variety of sexist ideas about women.”<br>— Safiya Umoja Noble</div>

  <p>Together, these works dismantle the myth that technology is neutral. From racist autocomplete suggestions to discriminatory image recognition, the evidence shows that digital systems mirror the very real inequalities of the offline world. These are not isolated bugs — they’re symptoms of deeper issues in how data is collected, categorized, and monetized.</p>

  <p>This isn’t just a question of tech literacy — it’s a political and social issue. Understanding the myth of neutrality is the first step in demanding more accountability and justice from the algorithms that increasingly govern our lives.</p>

    <h2>Bias in the Machine</h2>
    <p>Facial recognition sounds futuristic — until it can’t recognize your face. The <strong>Gender Shades</strong> study by Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru revealed that commercial AI systems often perform poorly on darker-skinned women.</p>
    <div class="quote">“The systems that fail us are often the ones we’re told are objective.”</div>
    <p>Buolamwini’s earlier thesis and subsequent work show how intersectional bias is deeply embedded in training data, developer assumptions, and lack of diversity in the tech industry itself.</p>

    <h2>Opinion Machines</h2>
    <p>Today’s platforms don’t just host content — they guide your opinions. <strong>Natali Helberger</strong>, in "The Political Power of Platforms," discusses how algorithmic curation shapes public discourse and how even well-meaning regulation can end up reinforcing dominant interests.</p>

    <h2>Can We Fix It?</h2>
    <p>It’s easy to feel stuck in the current system — but alternatives exist. Instead of accepting algorithmic bias as inevitable, we can push for more transparency, diverse datasets, ethical frameworks, and human-centered design.</p>
    <p><em>We can build again: federated platforms, ethical AI, and DIY tools are all ways to reclaim autonomy and challenge the dominant systems.</em></p>
